abstract: "This paper presents two algorithms for multi-agent dynamic coverage in spatiotemporal environments, where
the coverage algorithms are informed by the method of data
assimilation. In particular, we show that by considering the
information assimilation algorithm, here a Numerical Gaussian
Process Kalman Filter, the influence of measurements taken
at one position on the uncertainty of the estimate at another
location can be computed. We use this relationship to propose
new coverage algorithms. Furthermore, we show that the con-
trollers naturally extend to the multi-agent context, allowing for
a distributed-control central-information paradigm for multi-
agent coverage. Finally, we demonstrate the algorithms through
a realistic simulation of a team of UAVs collecting wind data
over a region in Austria."
